# fileHandler


I've built a robust file handler website that lets users easily upload files via a drag-and-drop interface. The site supports handling multiple sheets, validating the uploaded data, and exporting validated sheets. It includes pagination for better data navigation, clear toast notifications for user feedback, and smooth loading states to enhance user experience. The tech stack includes React and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB powering the backend.
